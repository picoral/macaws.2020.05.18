The writing samples are rough drafts of essays written by the students in response to curricular tasks every three to five weeks during each semester. The genres are personal narratives and personal accounts with argumentative tasks added at later time points. All learner texts have been tokenized, lemmatized, and automatically annotated for parts-of-speech. Next, they were manually annotated for target hypotheses by multiple annotators (see Falko-Handbuch). Finally, the target hypothesis layer of the corpus was also automatically lemmatized and annotated for parts-of-speech.</span></p><br><br><br><br><br>
